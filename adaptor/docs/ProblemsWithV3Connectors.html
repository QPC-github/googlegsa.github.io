      <h1> Problems with V3 Connectors </h1>
      <div>

        <p>
           Connectors push all data and do not allow the GSA to re-query data as needed. This means that
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the connector must have its own crawler to notice updates,</li>
          <li>the connector needs to keep track of the GSA’s state and the repository’s state, and</li>
          <li>if an error occurs on the GSA (due to load or some other intermittent issue) then there is no avenue for the GSA to re-obtain the file for indexing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each of these three items causes an issue.</p>
        <p>
          Item 1 means duplication of crawler-related code, configuration, and maintenance. This is made more severe by the GSA’s crawler having many diagnostics available but the connector’s crawler having few. There is no reasonable way for a user to understand the current state of a connector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Item 2 requires noticing updates to the repository, but also being able to handle failures from the GSA. Many connectors need to keep large amounts of state to correctly notice updates. This led to an initiative to provide large, high-availability data stores for use with connectors. That means that there can be three high-availability data stores in the system: the repository, the connector, and the GSA. To handle failures, the connector manager has a checkpoint system that requires connectors to be able to save and restore checkpoints in case of errors. For some repositories, these requirements are easy to deal with, however, for others they have required considerable amount of code. If any point in the repository’s history cannot be easily referenced (i.e., there isn’t a single identifier across the entire repository) this becomes a major problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Item 3 causes errors and bugs to be persistent. When an intermittent error occurs during indexing the GSA will not index the file. The only way to correct the error is by restarting a full, overwriting push of repository and hoping the second time fairs better. File system connector tests have shown that for document sets over 100,000, it is common to have a missing document.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not meant to dis connectors. Instead, it is meant to define the problems to be solved. The connector design is highly reasonable and does prove to work, but we want connectors to be easy to write and use, and the listed items slow development and comprehension.
